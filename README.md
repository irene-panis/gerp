# Game Recommendation Project (GERP)

Game Recommendation Project (placeholder name), or GERP for short, is a Letterboxd-inspired social media site for logging and reviewing video games where users can also receive personalized recommendations based on games they've played.

This project is being built by five UCSD grads (classes of '22 and '23); two making up the UI/UX team, two making up the data science team, and one making up the web development team (myself). The UI/UX team is responsible for creating the website's design while the data science team works to build the game recommendation aspect of the application. I will be responsible for building both the frontend and backend of this project.

GERP will be built using a React frontend, while the backend will be built with Express, Node.js, and PostgreSQL.

## Current progress
- UI/UX team: design/ideation, user research
- Data science team: working with Steam game data, building recommendation algorithm
- Web dev team: building the database using PostgreSQL
